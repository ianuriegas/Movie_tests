This program will:

1) Get reccomended movies based off a user input
2) Create a movie quiz based off a movies popularity
3) Create and modify a user's watchlist


Also (Notes):

- For the movie quiz, since we cannot just randomly pick a id for the movie I have established a program (id_finder.py) to generate
- tokens that are valid. The program isn't finished so don't be surprised if you receive duplicates in the quiz


Running the program (Bash scripts):

./quiz.bash

./reccomended.bash

./watchlist.bash


Packages:
source venv/bin/activate

or just install,

pip install tmdbv3api
